This is a simple notes-making application built using Express.js, the FS (File System) module, and a touch of frontend magic with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to create notes, store them as files on the server, and view their notes in a "Created Notes" section.

Features
Create Notes: Users can input text to create a note.
Store Notes: Notes are stored as files on the server using the Node.js fs module.
View Notes: A "Created Notes" section displays all stored notes dynamically.
Responsive Design: Frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive interface.
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js with Express.js.
File Storage: Node.js fs module for file-based note storage.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for UI design.

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd mini-notes-app

Install dependencies:

npm install
Start the server:

node server.js
The server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.

Open the application in your browser at:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000

How It Works
Creating a Note:

The user fills out a form to create a note.
The input is sent to the server via a POST request.
The server processes the input and writes it to a file in the notes directory.
Viewing Notes:

The server reads all files in the notes directory.
The filenames and their content are displayed in the "Created Notes" section.
Dependencies
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
FS Module: Core Node.js module for interacting with the file system.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
Install these dependencies using npm install as part of the setup.

Usage
Add a Note:

Navigate to the home page.
Enter your note in the text field and submit.
View Notes:

All your saved notes will appear in the "Created Notes" section.
Future Enhancements
Add functionality to edit or delete notes.
Use a database (e.g., MongoDB) for more robust note storage.
Implement user authentication for personalized note management.
Enhance the UI with more interactive components.
